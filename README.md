Day 33 - Rails Patterns
=========

Assignment: Create simple search engine

1. Seed data to create quotes, like snippets, with "Author Name" and "Quote"
2. Have a search form that I can search for either the author name and the text
   of the quote
3. Enable tagging, where in the seed, you tag each quote with 2-3 tags
4. When viewing each quote, I should see the tag list, and click on the tag name
   to view all quotes tagged with that quote
5. Add contact us form using `mail_form` that emails you
